[Documentation](https://docs.rs/procfs)

This crate is an interface to the `proc` pseudo-filesystem on linux, which is normally mounted as `/proc`.
Long-term, this crate aims to be fairly feature complete, but at the moment not all files are exposed.
See the docs for info on what's supported.

## Examples
There are several examples in the docs and in the [examples folder](https://github.com/eminence/procfs/tree/master/examples)
of the code repository.

Here's a small example that prints out all processes that are running on the same tty as the calling
process.  This is very similar to what "ps" does in its default mode:

```rust
extern crate procfs;

fn main() {
    let me = procfs::Process::myself().unwrap();
    let tps = procfs::ticks_per_second().unwrap();

    println!("{: >5} {: <8} {: >8} {}", "PID", "TTY", "TIME", "CMD");

    let tty = format!("pty/{}", me.stat.tty_nr().1);
    for prc in procfs::all_processes() {
        if prc.stat.tty_nr == me.stat.tty_nr {
            // total_time is in seconds
            let total_time =
                (prc.stat.utime + prc.stat.stime) as f32 / (tps as f32);
            println!(
                "{: >5} {: <8} {: >8} {}",
                prc.stat.pid, tty, total_time, prc.stat.comm
            );
        }
    }
}
```

## Cargo features

The following cargo features are available:

* `chrono` -- Default.  Optional.  This feature enables a few methods that return values as `DateTime` objects.
* `backtrace` -- Optional.  This feature lets you get a stack trace whenever an `InternalError` is raised.
